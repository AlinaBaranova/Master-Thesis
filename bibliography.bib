@incollection{Fujihara.2012,
 abstract = {Automatic lyrics-to-audio alignment techniques have been drawing attention in the last years and various studies have been made in this field. The objective of lyrics-to-audio alignment is to estimate a temporal relationship between lyrics and musical audio signals and can be applied to various applications such as Karaoke-style lyrics display. In this contribution, we provide an overview of recent development in this research topic, where we put a particular focus on categorization of various methods and on applications.},
